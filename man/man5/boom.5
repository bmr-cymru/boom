boom.conf \(em boom configuration file
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB/boot/boom/boom.conf\fP
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBboom.conf\fP is loaded during the initialisation of boom and contains
configuration keys affecting boom's global behaviour and the setting of
boom's legacy configuration support.

The file is structured in \fBINI\fP format: section headers appear in
square brackets and configuration values appear as key-value pairs with
one pair per line.
.
.SH SECTIONS
.TP
.B global
The global section contains the \fBboot_path\fP and \fBboom_path\fP
keys that may be used to override the location of the \fB/boot\fP
mount point and \fB/boot/boom\fP configuration directory respectively.
.TP
.B legacy
The legacy section contains settings to enable and configure support
for non-BLS boot loader configuration formats.

To enable legacy boot loader support set the \fBenable\fP key to
\fByes\fP or \fBtrue\fP and set the \fBformat\fP key to the required
format (currently only \fbgrub\fP syntax is supported).

If the value of the \fBsync\fP key is true the legacy configuration
will be automatically written whenever entries are added, removed, or
modified.
